# PsychicGame

This game is built using Javascript where you have to guess what letter the computer is thinking of and you get 9 total guesses. 
If you guess correctly you get 1 win and if you guess incorrectly you get 1 loss.  The wins and losses keep adding up and you try to 
beat the computer.

Super simple javascript logic for the first game!
